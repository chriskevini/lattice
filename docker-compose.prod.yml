# Production override - uses pre-built image, no dev volumes
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml
#
# This configuration:
# - Uses pre-built Docker image from CI/CD (set via .env)
# - Removes volume mounts (no hot reload, smaller attack surface)
# - No local build (faster deployment, no CPU spike)
#
# .env should contain: BOT_IMAGE=ghcr.io/chriskevini/lattice-bot:<sha>

services:
  bot:
    # Use pre-built image from CI/CD
    image: ${BOT_IMAGE}
    # No volume mounts in production (security + smaller attack surface)
    volumes: []
